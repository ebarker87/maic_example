# maic_example
This script conducts a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) using the maic package.
The individual patient data (IPD) and aggregate data were simulated using seperate code. These data do not represent real trial data and are for illustration purpuses only.
This example was presented at the R for HTA conference 2022: "MAIC-ing it eay: R for matching-adjusted indirect comparisons".
